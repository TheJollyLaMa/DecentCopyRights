# DecentCopyRights
A decentralized database persistently updated by copyrights entering the public domain.



Every year copyrighted material is released into the public domain as their respective copyrights expire.
A decentralized database that documents the expiry of private copyrights will automatically ensure the disemmination of the successful original knowledge.
A community of innovators will be the center of such a database.
The value in the community will be a display of their innovative power to apply and reapply the value their ancestors found in the days of yesteryear.

You'd be surprised at the value that was missed during the hustle of the first modern industrial revolutions! ;)
